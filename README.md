# TheRoad
A simple game about the important scenes in "The Road" by Cormac McCarthy made for my school's English class project  
Music made by my friend, everything else made by me  
The game can be played on the browser here: https://j02.itch.io/the-road  
The main character is the father who can be controlled with arrow keys, the keys J K L can be pressed whenever the father makes an important decision. A wrong decision leads to game over.  

The important scenes from the book are:
* When the father shoots the kidnapper from the truck
* When they find the naked people in the basement
* When the father dies

Overall Positives:
* Decent quality, considering the time I had was only 6 days
* Gameplay is straightforward

Negatives:
* Not very enjoyable
* Animations could've been a lot better with more time
